Grammatical category:

a closed system of mutually exclusive and opposed to each other grammatical meanings (grammemes),
which defines a partition of an extensive collection of word forms (or a small set of high-frequency word forms with
an abstract type of meaning) into disjoint classes, the difference between which significantly affects the degree of
grammatical correctness of the text.

Grammatical categories by the nature of grammatical meanings:

- content-related(?) (nominative, semantic, referential) grammatical categories directly involved in the reflection of extra-linguistic
reality;

- formal (asemantic, formal-structural) categories that reflect only purely compatible restrictions of word forms
(for example, matching grammatical categories are involved in the design of matching relationships:
for example, gender, number and case of the adjective, gender, number and face of the verb,
as well as formal structural morphological lexeme characteristics - such as types of declension and conjugation).

Content-related(?) Grammar Categories

Among these grammatical categories are:

- nominative (objective, nominative, dictal; for example, the number of a noun, the gender of animate nouns,
the animacy of nouns, the degree of comparison of an adjective, partly a verb form,
partly transitive / intransitive and personality / impersonality of a verb, specificity / universality of reference);
- subjective-objective, reflecting the properties and relationships of objects from the point of view of participants
in a speech act;
- relational (syntactic) (case of a noun, adjective / predicative of an adjective, representation of a verb,
communicative role).


Subjective objective

Subjective-objective grammatical categories are divided into:

- actualization (deictic, shifter, index) (for example, verb tense, pronouns);
- modal, for example, the mood of the verb; syntagma reference / non-reference);
- communicative (for example, certainty / uncertainty and the communicative role of syntagma);
- evaluative, that is, expressing an assessment (for example, the degree of intensity of a sign in predicate words,
a subjective assessment in nouns);
- interpretative, reflecting the subjective point of view of the observer (the pledge of the verb, partly the verb form,
partly the number of the noun, partly the gender of the animated nouns, partly the animation of the nouns).

Relational

Relational grammatical categories are divided into:

- active (expressing valency, that is, the ability to enter into syntactic relations with neighboring words,
for example, transition / intransigence, personality / impersonality, partly pledge and diathesis);

- passive (expressing the syntactic role of the word in the utterance, for example, the case of the noun,
the predicativity / attributiveness of the adjective, the representation of the verb).

Grammatical features are different, such as: non-permanent "time, number and case" and constant "gender, declension."

([MALKOVSKYETAL] - Формальная модель русского словоизменения - The formal model of the Russian inflection, FMRI)

All words belong to classes:
- "immutable words"
- "mutable words"

Grammatical variables (GV).

- animacy одушевленность,
- gender род,
- number число,
- case падеж,
- aspect вид,
- person лицо,
- voice залог,
- reflexivity возвратность,
- tense время,
- conjugation наклонение,
- degree степень

Grammatical features

- syntactical class (S-class)
- morphological class (M-class)
- paradigmatical class (P-class), alterations, exceptions

Paradigm is a set of grammatical variables.
M-class consists of with common set of GV, free GV and common spectrum of GV values.
(eg vector (7 8 2 1 0 0) - word of 7th M-class, 8th P-class, inanimate, masculine, without cases and number can be
associated with a stem "лев-" of the word "лев".

(M-class roughly corresponds with part of speech)
3-classes of inflected words:
 - pronouns местоименные, (gender, number, case)
 - substantives субстантивные, (number, case)
 - adjectives адъективные (gender, number, case)
1 class of conjugated спрягаемые. (person, gender, number, tense)

Subset of M-class with same flections - P-class. 24 of those in FMRI.

Exceptions are not included in the P-classes, handled separately. (26 exceptions in FMRI)

FMRI has 55 alternations.

Rare exceptions - described with multiple stems.

S-class is comprised of words and forms with common sets of GV and common syntactic functions.

For many words S-class corresponds directly with M-class, but there are some exceptions. For example,
some nouns can be like adjectives.
